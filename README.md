# yummy-recipes
Yummy recipes provides a platform for users to keep track of their awesome recipes and share with others if they so wish.

follow this [link](https://indungu.github.io/yummy-recipes)

## Notes
Well as you will realize there is still a lot more that needs to be done, some elements are irresponsive, some links are just dead links.
The wire-frame however covers/showcases the following features
``` 
  1. Creating an account 
  2. Login in to an account
  3. A landing page [Dashboard] after a successful login
```

## How to Use
On following the [link](https://indungu.github.io/yummy-recipes) a `Welcome` page is displayed.

Click the `Sign Up` button and this opens the `signup` page where which you provide account creation details and click `Submit`
to create your account.

The Dashboard is really just a mock-up of how the complete and functional dashboard will look. 
On successful it opens to a default view of the list of categories the user has created {the last four}.
There is a `View Recipes` link button under each of the diplayed categories which when clicked reveals
 all the recipes in that category.
 
 ## To-Do
 ```
  I.  Add Create/Delete capability for recipes and recipe categories
  II. Implement backend with Python Flask Microframework
 ```
